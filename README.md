# V2X-Communication
Demonstration of scenarios for automatic switching in between V2X modes.
This is a .m file which should be run in MATLAB.
This code simulates a scenario where switching is required from V2V to V2I.
Customary inputs can also be given to the file for simulation of different scenarios.
With minor tweaks, this can be simulated for different scenarios.
